# Create SignIn and SignUp in Blup

<!-- <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/blup-settings.gif" alt="SignIn & SignUp"><figcaption><p>SignIn & SignUP</p></figcaption></figure> -->

1\. **Create Screens:** Build separate screens for sign-in and sign-up. These screens should include fields for users to input their credentials, such as email and password.

2\. **Implement Logic:** In the sign-in screen, add logic in the Logic Panel to handle user authentication. This logic should verify the user's credentials, typically by sending them to a backend server for validation. If the credentials are valid, the user is logged in and directed to the main app screen.

3\. **Connect to Backend:** Ensure your sign-in screen is connected to the backend server where user data is stored. This connection allows the app to verify user credentials and retrieve user information from the server.

4\. **Sign-Up Functionality:** Similarly, in the sign-up screen, implement logic to handle user registration. When a user signs up, their information is sent to the backend server to create a new account.
