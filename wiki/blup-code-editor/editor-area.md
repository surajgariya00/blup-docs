# Editor Area

This is your coding space, operating like a traditional editor with a custom-built color scheme for both light and dark modes, enhancing readability and appearance.&#x20;

Right-clicking within the editor unveils various actions, most akin to those found in the file explorer. However, we'll delve into two specific options unique to the editor.

Certainly! Let’s explore the additional features of the **Editor Area**:

1. **Go To Declarations**:
   * Clicking this option redirects your cursor to the line in the file where the variable is declared.
   * The editor automatically detects the word if you haven’t selected the entire word. If you have, it finds the declaration for the selected part.
   * If no declaration is found, nothing happens.
2. **Go To Usages**:
   * Clicking this option opens a pop-up displaying all the usages of the particular word.
   * If you haven’t selected the word, the editor automatically detects the word at the cursor.
   * If you have selected the word, it finds the usage of the selected part, providing the code snippet, line number, and file path where the word is used.
   * This feature is immensely helpful during coding and is widely utilized by developers for efficient coding.

Additionally, the Editor Area offers another feature that enhances coding ease and efficiency: the **QT AI Auto Completer**. Let’s delve into its details.

### **QT AI Auto Completer**:

* Enables you to input prompts, generating code snippets based on the prompt.
* Understands both the code and file context.
* Functions as a helpful coding co-pilot, assisting you in effortlessly creating new functionalities and writing logic.
* The code is automatically generated at the cursor location.
* For example, if you prompt “Write a function to add two numbers,” it will generate a code snippet at the current cursor position, making your coding tasks more convenient.

### Shortcut Keys in  **Blup Code Editor**

Let’s explore the **time-saving shortcuts** available in the **Blup Code Editor**. These shortcuts can significantly enhance your productivity by allowing you to perform common tasks without relying on your mouse. Here are some useful keyboard shortcuts:

1. **Ctrl + F**: This shortcut enables you to **search for a specific word within the currently opened file**. It’s a quick way to locate occurrences of a particular term or function.
2. **Ctrl + R**: Use this shortcut to **replace a word** within the currently opened file. It’s handy when you need to make consistent changes throughout your code.
3. **Ctrl + Shift + F**: Pressing this combination opens the **Find in Files dialog**. You can search for a specific keyword across multiple files within your project. It’s particularly useful when you’re working with larger projects and need to find occurrences globally.
4. **Ctrl + Shift + R**: Similar to the previous shortcut, this one opens the **Replace in Files dialog**. It allows you to search for a word and replace it with another across multiple files. Great for bulk changes!
5. **Ctrl + Mouse left click**: When you click on a word while holding down the Ctrl key, it performs a couple of actions:
   * If the word has a **declaration**, it takes you to that declaration.
   * If it’s the **root declaration**, it opens the usages for that word. This is especially helpful for navigating through your codebase efficiently.
